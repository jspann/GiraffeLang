# ![alt text][logo] Giraffe Programming Language

Please note that this software is **still in BETA**.

## What is it?
A basic programming language that is designed to work on multiple platforms (Programmed in ANSI C), and to be welcoming to new programmers.


## Giraffe Basics
#### Defining a variable:
 ```
 <Type> <variable name> = <value>;
 Num daleks = 5; 
 ```

#### Defining a ([constant](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constant_(programming))):
 ```
 <variable name> :: <value>;
  NumOfDoctors :: 4; 
 ```



#### Commenting:
 ```
 #This is a cool comment that is ignored by the compiler!
 ```

## TODO
**Keep in mind that it is still in __BETA__. There is much to do (which is why it is in beta) but currently I am working on:**

 -A form of output/ an executable format

 -Creating a linux version of the compiler

 -Making the compiler more memory efficient
 
 -Building libraries
